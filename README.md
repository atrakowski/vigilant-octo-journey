# README

To get the demo app up and running, run `bin/setup` and then `bin/rails server`. There are also seeds to play around with and an optional DevContainer setup.

You can run the tests via `bin/rspec`.

**NOTE**: The app is not production-ready! Also the mail setup is not tested yet, though all mails are currently sent from Devise, i.e. they are most likely fine or need just a little bit of work.
